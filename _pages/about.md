I started as a Marie Curie Postdoctoral fellow in the Quantum Materials Dynamics group with [Prof. Alessandro Lunghi](https://www.tcd.ie/physics/research/groups/quantum-materials-dynamics/) at the School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland in October 2024.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry with honours from [Seth Anandram Jaipuria College](https://www.sajaipuriacollege.ac.in/), the University of Calcutta, West Bengal, India in 2012. I finished my Master's degree with a specialization in Inorganic Chemistry at the [University of Calcutta (Rajabazar Science College, Kolkata)](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Chemistry.html) in 2014. Then I moved to the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai in 2015 to conduct my Ph.D. research with [Prof. Gopalan Rajaraman](https://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/~rajaraman/) at the Department of Chemistry. My research interests during my PhD include the investigation of Spin-Hamiltonian parameters in single-molecule magnets containing transition metal and lanthanide coordination complexes through ab initio (CASSCF/MRPT2) and DFT methodologies. In 2021, I joined the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral researcher to work with [Prof. Laura Gagliardi](https://gagliardigroup.uchicago.edu/). There, I explored spin transition properties of a binuclear transition metal complex, excited states of actinide systems using multi-configuration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) and also investigated the band structure in redox-active 2D/3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using periodic DFT. After that, I spent about a year at the the [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/), Germany from November 2023-September 2024 to join the Organic Electronics group with [Prof. Denis Andrienko](https://pages-andrienko-10bcaa2045685d6c9509367c68ef5f030a701b968e1f8e8.pages.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/people/sarkar/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher where I explored the photoluminescent properties and charge carrier transport in perovskite systems using DFT.
