abstract = {Modeling actinides with electronic structure theories is challenging because these systems present a strong ligand field and metal-ligand covalency. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of pair-density functional theory (PDFT) for the calculation of vertical excitation energies in An(III), [AnIIICl6]3-, and [AnVIO2]2+ (An = U, Np, Pu, and Am). We compare the performance of PDFT, hybrid PDFT, and multistate PDFT with traditional active-space methods followed by perturbation theory, like multistate CASPT2, and with experimental data. Overall, multistate PDFT gives quantitative agreement with multistate CASPT2 at a significantly reduced computational cost.}

abstract = {Two possible explanations for the temperature dependence of spin-crossover (SCO) behavior in the dimeric triple-decker Cr(II) complex ([($\eta$5-C5Me5)Cr($\mu$2:$\eta$5-P5)Cr($\eta$5-C5Me5)]+) have been offered. One invokes variations in antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions, whereas the other posits the development of a strong ligand-field effect favoring the low-spin ground state. We perform multireference electronic structure calculations based on the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory to resolve these effects. We find quintet, triplet, and singlet electronic ground states, respectively, for the experimental geometries at high, intermediate, and low temperatures. The ground-state transition from quintet to triplet at an intermediate temperature derives from increased antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions. By contrast, the ground-state transition from triplet to singlet at low temperature can be attributed to increased ligand-field effects, which dominate with continued variations in antiferromagnetic coupling. This study provides quantitative detail for the degree to which these two effects can act in concert for the observed SCO behavior in this complex and others subject to temperature-dependent variations in geometry.}

Particularly, molecules with D5h symmetry played an important role in understanding various contributions to the barrier height, and more than fifty molecules are reported now, with several variations yielding the absence of SIM behaviour to some of the best. In this chapter, we aim to give an overview of the variation observed in this class and another new class of molecules, i.e. Ln-encapsulated fullerene as SMMs. Particularly, we aim to showcase the strength of these methods in understanding the mechanism of magnetisation relaxation and the role of symmetry in dictating the desired magnetic characteristics.}

abstract = {Technetium-99, a $\beta$-emitter produced from 235U fission, poses a challenge for the nuclear industry due to co-extraction of pertechnetate (TcO4-) with the actinides (An) during nuclear fuel reprocessing. Previous studies suggested that direct coordination of pertechnetate with An plays an important role in the coextraction process. However, few studies have provided direct evidence for An-TcO4- bonding in the solid state, and even fewer in solution. The present study describes synthesis and structural elucidation of a family of thorium(IV)-pertechnetate/perrhenate (ReO4-, nonradioactive surrogate) compounds, which is obtained by dissolution of thorium oxyhydroxide in perrhenic/pertechnic acid followed by crystallization, with or without heating. For reaction ratios of 3:1, 4:1, and 6:1 MO4-/Th(IV) (M = Tc, Re), the crystallized compounds reflect the same ratio, suggesting facile and flexible coordination. Nine structures reveal 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional frameworks with varying topologies. While a multitude of compounds isolated from 4:1 (and 6:1) reaction solutions feature Th monomers linked by MO4-, the 3:1 reaction solution yielded the well-known dihydroxide-bridged thorium dimer, linked, and capped by MO4-. Density functional theory calculations on ReO4-/TcO4- isomorphs suggest similar bonding characteristics in the solid state, but experimental solution characterization noted differences. Specifically, small-angle X-ray scattering studies suggest the bonding of Th-TcO4- persists in solution, while Th-ReO4- bonding is less apparent.}

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) inorganic materials have emerged as exciting platforms for (opto)electronic, thermoelectric, magnetic, and energy storage applications. However, electronic redox tuning of these materials can be difficult. Instead, 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the possibility of electronic tuning through stoichiometric redox changes, with several examples featuring one to two redox events per formula unit. Here, we demonstrate that this principle can be extended over a far greater span with the isolation of four discrete redox states in the 2D MOFs LixFe3(THT)2 (x = 0–3, THT = triphenylenehexathiol). This redox modulation results in 10,000-fold greater conductivity, p- to n-type carrier switching, and modulation of antiferromagnetic coupling. Physical characterization suggests that changes in carrier density drive these trends with relatively constant charge transport activation energies and mobilities. This series illustrates that 2D MOFs are uniquely redox flexible, making them an ideal materials platform for tunable and switchable applications.}

abstract = {Early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have yet to show magnetic properties similar to those of highly anisotropic lanthanide-based ones. However, there are not many studies exploring the late-actinides (more than half-filled f shells) as potential candidates for SMM applications. We computationally explored the electronic structure and magnetic properties of a hypothetical Cf(III) complex isostructural to the experimentally synthesized Dy(dbm)3(bpy) complex (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; dbm = dibenzoylmethanoate) via multireference methods and compared them to those of the Dy(III) analogue. This study shows that the Cf(III) complex can behave as a SMM and has a greater magnetic susceptibility compared to other experimentally and computationally studied early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) magnetic complexes. However, Cf spontaneously undergoes $\alpha$-decay and converts to Cm. Thus, we also explored the isostructural Cm(III)-based complex. The computed magnetic susceptibility and g-tensor values show that the Cm(III) complex has poor SMM behavior in comparison to both the Dy(III) and Cf(III) complexes, suggesting that the performance of Cf(III)-based magnets may be affected by $\alpha$-decay and can explain the poor performance of experimentally studied Cf(III)-based molecular magnets in the literature. Further, this study suggests that the ligand field is dominant in Cf(III), which helps to increase the magnetization blocking barrier by nearly 3 times that of its 4f congener.}

DFT calculations reveal that the barrier for O⋯O bond cleavage is higher with the late transition metals (Co{,} Ni{,} and Cu) than the early transition metals (Cr{,} Mn{,} and Fe){,} and the formed late metal–oxo species are also thermodynamically less stable. The higher barrier may be due to electronic repulsion because of the pairing of d electrons. In the late transition metal series{,} the electron goes into an antibonding orbital{,} which decreases the bond order and hence decreases the possibility of metal–oxo formation. Computed structural parameters and spin densities suggest that valence tautomerism occurs in the late transition metal–oxo species which remain as a metal–oxyl. Our findings support the concept of the “Oxo Wall”.}

This is the first time a Pt(II) complex of an organotellurenyl cation donor-acceptor ligand has been reported. Complex 7 was characterized by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 125Te), FT-IR spectroscopy, CHN analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies and DFT analysis infer that the Te center in 7 behaves as an ambiphilic ligand, accepting electrons from the N-atom of the ppy moiety and the O-atom of the carboxylate groups while simultaneously donating electrons to the Pt(II) center. The 2D-fingerprint plots derived from the Hirshfeld surface analysis reveal multiple intermolecular interactions in the packing diagrams of complex 7. The natural charges accumulated on the atoms in complex 7 were calculated by Natural Population Analysis (NPA). In addition, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap in 7 was calculated.}

The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02?S?cm?1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2$\sigma$=7.0?10?9?W?m?1?K?2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature.

The contributions of selected metal nodes in the radiation stability of MOFs within the isostructural M-UiO-66 series (where M = Zr, Ce, Hf, Th, and Pu; Zr-UiO-66 experiments were executed in a previous work) have been determined. Ce-, Hf-, and Th-UiO-66 MOF samples were irradiated via gamma and He-ion methodologies to obtain doses up to 3 MGy and 85 MGy, respectively, the latter strikingly higher than that obtained in most other studies. Appreciable self-irradiation constituted the total absorbed doses, up to 31 MGy of the gamma-irradiated Pu-UiO-66 samples. Structural degradation was ascertained by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray total scattering, vibrational spectroscopy, and, where possible, N2 physisorption isotherms. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy provided atomic-level mechanistic insights to reveal that the node-linker connection was most susceptible to radiation damage. Density functional theory calculations were performed on cluster models to evaluate the binding energy of the linkers to each metal node. While the isostructures disclosed the same breakdown signatures, distinct radiation sensitivity as a function of metal selection was evident and followed the trend Hf-UiO-66 ∼Zr-UiO-66 > Th-UiO-66 > Pu-UiO-66 > Ce-UiO-66. We anticipate that these endeavors will contribute to the rational design of radiation-resistant materials for targeted applications.}

Here we present a computational protocol based on multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory for computing singlet-triplet gaps and zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters in Cr(IV) aryl complexes. We find that two multireference methods, multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and hybrid multistate pair-density functional theory (HMS-PDFT), perform better than Kohn-Sham density functional theory for singlet-triplet gaps. Despite the very small values of the ZFS parameters, both multireference methods performed qualitatively well. MS-CASPT2 and HMS-PDFT performed particularly well for predicting the trend in the ratio of the rhombic and axial ZFS parameters, |E/D|. We have also investigated the dependence and sensitivity of the calculated ZFS parameters on the active space and the molecular geometry. The methodologies outlined here can guide future prediction of ZFS parameters in molecular qubit candidates.}

The principle of ″action-of-points″ drives specific chemical reactions between the defect sites of single wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ppb levels of gaseous hydrogen sulfide. This is manifested as changes in the electrical conductivity of the conductive CNT-ensemble (cCNT) and visually tracked as enthalpic modulations at the site of the reaction through infrared thermometry. Importantly, the principle has been observed for a variety of analytes such as NH3, H2O, and H2S, leading to distinctly correlatable changes in reactivity and conductivity changes. Theoretical calculations based on the density functional theory in the presence and absence of applied electric field reveal that the applied electric field activates the H2S gas molecules by charge polarization, yielding favorable energetics.

Based on the nature of the equatorial and axial ligands, which were found to tune the zero-field splitting, the complexes were classified into four groups. The experimental zero-field splitting parameters D which, for the various structures are in a range of +30 to +60 cm−1, as well as the g and E values are well reproduced. The investigation of the electronic structure shows that in these pentagonal bipyramidal complexes the donors and symmetry in the equatorial plane play an important role in the values of the axial zero-field splitting parameter D, and breaking of the horizontal plane of symmetry was found to enhance the magnitude of the D value. Although negative values of D are a desired condition for SIMs, many CoII based SIMs with positive zero-field splitting are fundamentally important to understand the nature of magnetic anisotropy, and seven coordinate CoII complexes with a large overall crystal field splitting might provide a way forward in this class of molecules.}

abstract = {Heterometallic Anderson wheels of formula [(VIVO)2M II5(hmp)10Cl2](ClO4)2{\textperiodcentered}2MeOH (M = Ni,1; Co,2) have been synthesised from the solvothermal reaction of M(ClO4)2{\textperiodcentered}6H2O and VCl3with hmpH (2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine). The metallic skeleton describes a centred hexagon, with the two vanadyl ions sitting on opposing sides of the outer ring. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation measurements indicate the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Theoretical calculations based on density functional methods reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally, and rationalise the parameters extracted.}

abstract = {Ab initio calculations performed in two three-coordinate complexes [Mn{N(SiMe3)2}3] (1) and [K(18-crown-6) (Et2O)2][Cr{N(SiMe3)2}3] (2) reveal record-high magnetic anisotropy with the D values -64 and -15 cm-1, respectively, enlisting d4 ions back in the race for single-ion magnets. A detailed spin-vibrational analysis performed of 1 and 2 suggests dominance under barrier relaxation due to the flexible coordination spheres around the metal ion. Furthermore, several in silico models were constructed by varying the nature of donor atoms based on the X-ray structure of 1 and 2, unveiling much larger anisotropy and robust single-ion magnet (SIM) characteristics for some of the models offering design clues for low-coordinate transition-metal SIMs.}

abstract = {Reaction of Ni(OTf)2with the bisbidentate quaterpyridine ligandLresults in the self-assembly of a tetrahedral, paramagnetic cage [NiII4L6]8+. By selectively exchanging the bound triflate from [OTf⊂NiII4L6](OTf)7(1), we have been able to prepare a series of host-guest complexes that feature an encapsulated paramagnetic tetrahalometallate ion inside this paramagnetic host giving [MIIX4⊂NiII4L6](OTf)6, where MIIX42−= MnCl42−(2), CoCl42−(5), CoBr42−(6), NiCl42−(7), and CuBr42−(8) or [MIIIX4⊂NiII4L6](OTf)7, where MIIIX4−= FeCl4−(3) and FeBr4−(4). Triflate-to-tetrahalometallate exchange occurs in solution and can also be accomplished through single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations. Host-guest complexes1-8all crystallise as homochiral racemates in monoclinic space groups, wherein the four {NiN6} vertexes within a single Ni4L6unit possess the same$\Delta$or$\Lambda$stereochemistry. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation data show that the magnetic exchange between metal ions in the host [NiII4] complex, and between the host and the MX4n−guest, are of comparable magnitude and antiferromagnetic in nature. Theoretically derived values for the magnetic exchange are in close agreement with experiment, revealing that large spin densities on the electronegative X-atoms of particular MX4n−guest molecules lead to stronger host-guest magnetic exchange interactions.}
