I started as a postdoctoral researcher in the Organic Electronics group with [Prof. Denis Andrienko](https://www2.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/~andrienk/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/), Germany in November 2023. Here, I am focusing on studying the interfacial charge recombination processes in metal halide perovskite solar cells.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry with honours from [Seth Anandram Jaipuria College](https://www.sajaipuriacollege.ac.in/), the University of Calcutta, West Bengal, India in 2012. I finished my Master's degree with a specialization in Inorganic Chemistry at the [University of Calcutta (Rajabazar Science College, Kolkata)](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Chemistry.html) in 2014. Then I moved to the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai in 2015 to conduct my Ph.D. research with [Prof. Gopalan Rajaraman](https://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/~rajaraman/) at the Department of Chemistry. My research interests during my PhD include the investigation of Spin-Hamiltonian parameters in single-molecule magnets containing transition metal and lanthanide coordination complexes through ab initio (CASSCF/MRPT2) and DFT methodologies. In 2021, I joined the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral researcher to work with [Prof. Laura Gagliardi](https://gagliardigroup.uchicago.edu/). There I worked in spin-crossover transition metal complexes and actinide molecules using multi-configuration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) and investigated the electronic band structure in redox-active 2D/3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using periodic DFT.
