abstract = {Modeling actinides with electronic structure theories is challenging because these systems present a strong ligand field and metal-ligand covalency. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of pair-density functional theory (PDFT) for the calculation of vertical excitation energies in An(III), [AnIIICl6]3-, and [AnVIO2]2+ (An = U, Np, Pu, and Am). We compare the performance of PDFT, hybrid PDFT, and multistate PDFT with traditional active-space methods followed by perturbation theory, like multistate CASPT2, and with experimental data. Overall, multistate PDFT gives quantitative agreement with multistate CASPT2 at a significantly reduced computational cost.}

abstract = {Two possible explanations for the temperature dependence of spin-crossover (SCO) behavior in the dimeric triple-decker Cr(II) complex ([($\eta$5-C5Me5)Cr($\mu$2:$\eta$5-P5)Cr($\eta$5-C5Me5)]+) have been offered. One invokes variations in antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions, whereas the other posits the development of a strong ligand-field effect favoring the low-spin ground state. We perform multireference electronic structure calculations based on the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory to resolve these effects. We find quintet, triplet, and singlet electronic ground states, respectively, for the experimental geometries at high, intermediate, and low temperatures. The ground-state transition from quintet to triplet at an intermediate temperature derives from increased antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions. By contrast, the ground-state transition from triplet to singlet at low temperature can be attributed to increased ligand-field effects, which dominate with continued variations in antiferromagnetic coupling. This study provides quantitative detail for the degree to which these two effects can act in concert for the observed SCO behavior in this complex and others subject to temperature-dependent variations in geometry.}

In this chapter, we aim to give an overview of the electronic structureElectronic structure method (ab initio SA-CASSCFComplete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF)/RASSI-SO/SINGLE{\_}ANISOSingle{\_}ANISO) to interpret, analyse and predict the magnetic properties of lanthanide-based SMMs. In the past few years, we have witnessed the evolution of blocking temperature (TB) and blocking barrierBlocking barrier (Ueff) of Dysprosium-based Lanthanide SIMs. Among other classes of molecules that have intriguing magnetic properties, a class of molecules with a higher-order Dnh symmetry (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}4, 5, 6 and 8) were predicted to yield superior magnetic properties and were later synthesised and found to possess very large Ueff values and decent blocking temperatures. Particularly, molecules with D5h symmetry played an important role in understanding various contributions to the barrier height, and more than fifty molecules are reported now, with several variations yielding the absence of SIM behaviour to some of the best. In this chapter, we aim to give an overview of the variation observed in this class and another new class of molecules, i.e. Ln-encapsulated fullerene as SMMs. Particularly, we aim to showcase the strength of these methods in understanding the mechanism of magnetisation relaxation and the role of symmetry in dictating the desired magnetic characteristics.}

abstract = {Technetium-99, a $\beta$-emitter produced from 235U fission, poses a challenge for the nuclear industry due to co-extraction of pertechnetate (TcO4-) with the actinides (An) during nuclear fuel reprocessing. Previous studies suggested that direct coordination of pertechnetate with An plays an important role in the coextraction process. However, few studies have provided direct evidence for An-TcO4- bonding in the solid state, and even fewer in solution. The present study describes synthesis and structural elucidation of a family of thorium(IV)-pertechnetate/perrhenate (ReO4-, nonradioactive surrogate) compounds, which is obtained by dissolution of thorium oxyhydroxide in perrhenic/pertechnic acid followed by crystallization, with or without heating. For reaction ratios of 3:1, 4:1, and 6:1 MO4-/Th(IV) (M = Tc, Re), the crystallized compounds reflect the same ratio, suggesting facile and flexible coordination. Nine structures reveal 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional frameworks with varying topologies. While a multitude of compounds isolated from 4:1 (and 6:1) reaction solutions feature Th monomers linked by MO4-, the 3:1 reaction solution yielded the well-known dihydroxide-bridged thorium dimer, linked, and capped by MO4-. Density functional theory calculations on ReO4-/TcO4- isomorphs suggest similar bonding characteristics in the solid state, but experimental solution characterization noted differences. Specifically, small-angle X-ray scattering studies suggest the bonding of Th-TcO4- persists in solution, while Th-ReO4- bonding is less apparent.}

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) inorganic materials have emerged as exciting platforms for (opto)electronic, thermoelectric, magnetic, and energy storage applications. However, electronic redox tuning of these materials can be difficult. Instead, 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the possibility of electronic tuning through stoichiometric redox changes, with several examples featuring one to two redox events per formula unit. Here, we demonstrate that this principle can be extended over a far greater span with the isolation of four discrete redox states in the 2D MOFs LixFe3(THT)2 (x = 0–3, THT = triphenylenehexathiol). This redox modulation results in 10,000-fold greater conductivity, p- to n-type carrier switching, and modulation of antiferromagnetic coupling. Physical characterization suggests that changes in carrier density drive these trends with relatively constant charge transport activation energies and mobilities. This series illustrates that 2D MOFs are uniquely redox flexible, making them an ideal materials platform for tunable and switchable applications.}

abstract = {Early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have yet to show magnetic properties similar to those of highly anisotropic lanthanide-based ones. However, there are not many studies exploring the late-actinides (more than half-filled f shells) as potential candidates for SMM applications. We computationally explored the electronic structure and magnetic properties of a hypothetical Cf(III) complex isostructural to the experimentally synthesized Dy(dbm)3(bpy) complex (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; dbm = dibenzoylmethanoate) via multireference methods and compared them to those of the Dy(III) analogue. This study shows that the Cf(III) complex can behave as a SMM and has a greater magnetic susceptibility compared to other experimentally and computationally studied early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) magnetic complexes. However, Cf spontaneously undergoes $\alpha$-decay and converts to Cm. Thus, we also explored the isostructural Cm(III)-based complex. The computed magnetic susceptibility and g-tensor values show that the Cm(III) complex has poor SMM behavior in comparison to both the Dy(III) and Cf(III) complexes, suggesting that the performance of Cf(III)-based magnets may be affected by $\alpha$-decay and can explain the poor performance of experimentally studied Cf(III)-based molecular magnets in the literature. Further, this study suggests that the ligand field is dominant in Cf(III), which helps to increase the magnetization blocking barrier by nearly 3 times that of its 4f congener.}

abstract  ={Terminal metal–oxo species of the early transition metal series are well known{,} whereas those for the late transition series are rare{,} and this is related to the “Oxo Wall”. Here{,} we have undertaken a theoretical study on the formation of metal–oxo species from the metal hydroperoxo species of the 3d series (Cr{,} Mn{,} Fe{,} Co{,} Ni{,} and Cu) with the ligand 14-TMC (1{,}4{,}8{,}11-tetramethyl-1{,}4{,}8{,}11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) via O⋯O bond cleavage. DFT calculations reveal that the barrier for O⋯O bond cleavage is higher with the late transition metals (Co{,} Ni{,} and Cu) than the early transition metals (Cr{,} Mn{,} and Fe){,} and the formed late metal–oxo species are also thermodynamically less stable. The higher barrier may be due to electronic repulsion because of the pairing of d electrons. In the late transition metal series{,} the electron goes into an antibonding orbital{,} which decreases the bond order and hence decreases the possibility of metal–oxo formation. Computed structural parameters and spin densities suggest that valence tautomerism occurs in the late transition metal–oxo species which remain as a metal–oxyl. Our findings support the concept of the “Oxo Wall”.}
