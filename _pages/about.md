I am a computational chemist with expertise in ab initio electronic structure methods containing open-shell inorganic/organic molecules and materials containing transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide ions. I use DFT and multiconfiguration-based methods such as CASSCF, CASPT2, NEVPT2 and MC-PDFT which are high-level quantum chemical approaches to treat strongly correlated systems. I started as a postdoctoral researcher in the Organic Electronics group with [Prof. Denis Andrienko](https://www2.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/~andrienk/) at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in November 2023. Here, I am focusing on studying the interfacial charge recombination processes in metal halide perovskite solar cells.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry honours from Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, in 2012. I finished my Master's degree with a specialization in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Calcutta (Rajabazar Science College, Kolkata) in 2014. Then I moved to the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai in 2015 to conduct my Ph.D. research with [Prof. Gopalan Rajaraman](https://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/~rajaraman/) at the Department of Chemistry. My research interests during my PhD include the investigation of Spin-Hamiltonian parameters in single-molecule magnets containing transition metal and lanthanide ions through ab initio and DFT methodologies. In 2021, I joined at the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral fellow to work with [Prof. Laura Gagliardi](https://gagliardigroup.uchicago.edu/). There I worked in the area of multi-configuration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) towards its application to magnetic systems and electronic band structure calculation of metal-organic frameworks.
