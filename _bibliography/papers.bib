abstract = {Modeling actinides with electronic structure theories is challenging because these systems present a strong ligand field and metal-ligand covalency. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of pair-density functional theory (PDFT) for the calculation of vertical excitation energies in An(III), [AnIIICl6]3-, and [AnVIO2]2+ (An = U, Np, Pu, and Am). We compare the performance of PDFT, hybrid PDFT, and multistate PDFT with traditional active-space methods followed by perturbation theory, like multistate CASPT2, and with experimental data. Overall, multistate PDFT gives quantitative agreement with multistate CASPT2 at a significantly reduced computational cost.}

abstract = {Two possible explanations for the temperature dependence of spin-crossover (SCO) behavior in the dimeric triple-decker Cr(II) complex ([($\eta$5-C5Me5)Cr($\mu$2:$\eta$5-P5)Cr($\eta$5-C5Me5)]+) have been offered. One invokes variations in antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions, whereas the other posits the development of a strong ligand-field effect favoring the low-spin ground state. We perform multireference electronic structure calculations based on the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory to resolve these effects. We find quintet, triplet, and singlet electronic ground states, respectively, for the experimental geometries at high, intermediate, and low temperatures. The ground-state transition from quintet to triplet at an intermediate temperature derives from increased antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions. By contrast, the ground-state transition from triplet to singlet at low temperature can be attributed to increased ligand-field effects, which dominate with continued variations in antiferromagnetic coupling. This study provides quantitative detail for the degree to which these two effects can act in concert for the observed SCO behavior in this complex and others subject to temperature-dependent variations in geometry.}

Particularly, molecules with D5h symmetry played an important role in understanding various contributions to the barrier height, and more than fifty molecules are reported now, with several variations yielding the absence of SIM behaviour to some of the best. In this chapter, we aim to give an overview of the variation observed in this class and another new class of molecules, i.e. Ln-encapsulated fullerene as SMMs. Particularly, we aim to showcase the strength of these methods in understanding the mechanism of magnetisation relaxation and the role of symmetry in dictating the desired magnetic characteristics.}

abstract = {Technetium-99, a $\beta$-emitter produced from 235U fission, poses a challenge for the nuclear industry due to co-extraction of pertechnetate (TcO4-) with the actinides (An) during nuclear fuel reprocessing. Previous studies suggested that direct coordination of pertechnetate with An plays an important role in the coextraction process. However, few studies have provided direct evidence for An-TcO4- bonding in the solid state, and even fewer in solution. The present study describes synthesis and structural elucidation of a family of thorium(IV)-pertechnetate/perrhenate (ReO4-, nonradioactive surrogate) compounds, which is obtained by dissolution of thorium oxyhydroxide in perrhenic/pertechnic acid followed by crystallization, with or without heating. For reaction ratios of 3:1, 4:1, and 6:1 MO4-/Th(IV) (M = Tc, Re), the crystallized compounds reflect the same ratio, suggesting facile and flexible coordination. Nine structures reveal 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional frameworks with varying topologies. While a multitude of compounds isolated from 4:1 (and 6:1) reaction solutions feature Th monomers linked by MO4-, the 3:1 reaction solution yielded the well-known dihydroxide-bridged thorium dimer, linked, and capped by MO4-. Density functional theory calculations on ReO4-/TcO4- isomorphs suggest similar bonding characteristics in the solid state, but experimental solution characterization noted differences. Specifically, small-angle X-ray scattering studies suggest the bonding of Th-TcO4- persists in solution, while Th-ReO4- bonding is less apparent.}

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) inorganic materials have emerged as exciting platforms for (opto)electronic, thermoelectric, magnetic, and energy storage applications. However, electronic redox tuning of these materials can be difficult. Instead, 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the possibility of electronic tuning through stoichiometric redox changes, with several examples featuring one to two redox events per formula unit. Here, we demonstrate that this principle can be extended over a far greater span with the isolation of four discrete redox states in the 2D MOFs LixFe3(THT)2 (x = 0–3, THT = triphenylenehexathiol). This redox modulation results in 10,000-fold greater conductivity, p- to n-type carrier switching, and modulation of antiferromagnetic coupling. Physical characterization suggests that changes in carrier density drive these trends with relatively constant charge transport activation energies and mobilities. This series illustrates that 2D MOFs are uniquely redox flexible, making them an ideal materials platform for tunable and switchable applications.}

abstract = {Early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have yet to show magnetic properties similar to those of highly anisotropic lanthanide-based ones. However, there are not many studies exploring the late-actinides (more than half-filled f shells) as potential candidates for SMM applications. We computationally explored the electronic structure and magnetic properties of a hypothetical Cf(III) complex isostructural to the experimentally synthesized Dy(dbm)3(bpy) complex (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; dbm = dibenzoylmethanoate) via multireference methods and compared them to those of the Dy(III) analogue. This study shows that the Cf(III) complex can behave as a SMM and has a greater magnetic susceptibility compared to other experimentally and computationally studied early-actinide-based (U, Np, and Pu) magnetic complexes. However, Cf spontaneously undergoes $\alpha$-decay and converts to Cm. Thus, we also explored the isostructural Cm(III)-based complex. The computed magnetic susceptibility and g-tensor values show that the Cm(III) complex has poor SMM behavior in comparison to both the Dy(III) and Cf(III) complexes, suggesting that the performance of Cf(III)-based magnets may be affected by $\alpha$-decay and can explain the poor performance of experimentally studied Cf(III)-based molecular magnets in the literature. Further, this study suggests that the ligand field is dominant in Cf(III), which helps to increase the magnetization blocking barrier by nearly 3 times that of its 4f congener.}

DFT calculations reveal that the barrier for O⋯O bond cleavage is higher with the late transition metals (Co{,} Ni{,} and Cu) than the early transition metals (Cr{,} Mn{,} and Fe){,} and the formed late metal–oxo species are also thermodynamically less stable. The higher barrier may be due to electronic repulsion because of the pairing of d electrons. In the late transition metal series{,} the electron goes into an antibonding orbital{,} which decreases the bond order and hence decreases the possibility of metal–oxo formation. Computed structural parameters and spin densities suggest that valence tautomerism occurs in the late transition metal–oxo species which remain as a metal–oxyl. Our findings support the concept of the “Oxo Wall”.}

This is the first time a Pt(II) complex of an organotellurenyl cation donor-acceptor ligand has been reported. Complex 7 was characterized by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 125Te), FT-IR spectroscopy, CHN analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies and DFT analysis infer that the Te center in 7 behaves as an ambiphilic ligand, accepting electrons from the N-atom of the ppy moiety and the O-atom of the carboxylate groups while simultaneously donating electrons to the Pt(II) center. The 2D-fingerprint plots derived from the Hirshfeld surface analysis reveal multiple intermolecular interactions in the packing diagrams of complex 7. The natural charges accumulated on the atoms in complex 7 were calculated by Natural Population Analysis (NPA). In addition, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap in 7 was calculated.}

The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02?S?cm?1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2$\sigma$=7.0?10?9?W?m?1?K?2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature.

The contributions of selected metal nodes in the radiation stability of MOFs within the isostructural M-UiO-66 series (where M = Zr, Ce, Hf, Th, and Pu; Zr-UiO-66 experiments were executed in a previous work) have been determined. Ce-, Hf-, and Th-UiO-66 MOF samples were irradiated via gamma and He-ion methodologies to obtain doses up to 3 MGy and 85 MGy, respectively, the latter strikingly higher than that obtained in most other studies. Appreciable self-irradiation constituted the total absorbed doses, up to 31 MGy of the gamma-irradiated Pu-UiO-66 samples. Structural degradation was ascertained by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray total scattering, vibrational spectroscopy, and, where possible, N2 physisorption isotherms. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy provided atomic-level mechanistic insights to reveal that the node-linker connection was most susceptible to radiation damage. Density functional theory calculations were performed on cluster models to evaluate the binding energy of the linkers to each metal node. While the isostructures disclosed the same breakdown signatures, distinct radiation sensitivity as a function of metal selection was evident and followed the trend Hf-UiO-66 ∼Zr-UiO-66 > Th-UiO-66 > Pu-UiO-66 > Ce-UiO-66. We anticipate that these endeavors will contribute to the rational design of radiation-resistant materials for targeted applications.}

Here we present a computational protocol based on multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory for computing singlet-triplet gaps and zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters in Cr(IV) aryl complexes. We find that two multireference methods, multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and hybrid multistate pair-density functional theory (HMS-PDFT), perform better than Kohn-Sham density functional theory for singlet-triplet gaps. Despite the very small values of the ZFS parameters, both multireference methods performed qualitatively well. MS-CASPT2 and HMS-PDFT performed particularly well for predicting the trend in the ratio of the rhombic and axial ZFS parameters, |E/D|. We have also investigated the dependence and sensitivity of the calculated ZFS parameters on the active space and the molecular geometry. The methodologies outlined here can guide future prediction of ZFS parameters in molecular qubit candidates.}

The principle of ″action-of-points″ drives specific chemical reactions between the defect sites of single wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ppb levels of gaseous hydrogen sulfide. This is manifested as changes in the electrical conductivity of the conductive CNT-ensemble (cCNT) and visually tracked as enthalpic modulations at the site of the reaction through infrared thermometry. Importantly, the principle has been observed for a variety of analytes such as NH3, H2O, and H2S, leading to distinctly correlatable changes in reactivity and conductivity changes. Theoretical calculations based on the density functional theory in the presence and absence of applied electric field reveal that the applied electric field activates the H2S gas molecules by charge polarization, yielding favorable energetics.

Based on the nature of the equatorial and axial ligands, which were found to tune the zero-field splitting, the complexes were classified into four groups. The experimental zero-field splitting parameters D which, for the various structures are in a range of +30 to +60 cm−1, as well as the g and E values are well reproduced. The investigation of the electronic structure shows that in these pentagonal bipyramidal complexes the donors and symmetry in the equatorial plane play an important role in the values of the axial zero-field splitting parameter D, and breaking of the horizontal plane of symmetry was found to enhance the magnitude of the D value. Although negative values of D are a desired condition for SIMs, many CoII based SIMs with positive zero-field splitting are fundamentally important to understand the nature of magnetic anisotropy, and seven coordinate CoII complexes with a large overall crystal field splitting might provide a way forward in this class of molecules.}

The metallic skeleton describes a centred hexagon, with the two vanadyl ions sitting on opposing sides of the outer ring.

A detailed spin-vibrational analysis performed of 1 and 2 suggests dominance under barrier relaxation due to the flexible coordination spheres around the metal ion. Furthermore, several in silico models were constructed by varying the nature of donor atoms based on the X-ray structure of 1 and 2, unveiling much larger anisotropy and robust single-ion magnet (SIM) characteristics for some of the models offering design clues for low-coordinate transition-metal SIMs.}

The halogenation reactions of diorganotelluride 1 are studied. In particular, the reaction of 1 with Br2 resulted in the isolation of a monoorgano dibromotelluronium(IV) cation, namely [2,6-(Me2NCH2)2C6H3TeBr2]·Br3 ([3]·Br3). The reaction of [3]·Br3 with K2PdCl4 afforded a monoorgano mixed dihalotelluronium(IV) cation, [2,6-(Me2NCH2)2C6H3TeClBr]·PdBr4 ([4]·PdBr4). When diorganotelluride 1 was treated with I2, the reaction afforded the tellurenium(II) cation, [2,6-(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Te]·I2·I3 ([5]·I2·I3). The reaction of 1 with HgCl2 resulted in the isolation of dimeric diorganoditelluroxonium(IV) cation, [2,6-(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Te(µ-O)]2·Hg2Cl6 ([6]·Hg2Cl6). A similar diorganoditelluroxonium(IV) cation, namely [2,6-(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Te(µ-O)]2·2Br ([6]·2Br) was also obtained by the reaction of 1 with Br2 and NaOH. The crystallographic studies suggest that for each compound, both the N atoms from the pendant arms make strong Intramolecular Chalcogen Bonding (IChB) interactions with the Te center(s). The presence of a strong N→Te IChB interaction in the synthesized compounds was further validated by DFT calculations.}

abstract = {Since the last decade, the focus in the area of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) has been shifting constructively towards the development of single-ion magnets (SIMs) based on transition metals and lanthanides. Although ground-breaking results have been witnessed for DyIII-based SIMs, significant results have also been obtained for some mononuclear transition metal SIMs. Among others, studies based on CoII ion are very prominent as they often exhibit high magnetic anisotropy or zero-field splitting parameters and offer a large barrier height for magnetisation reversal. Although CoII possibly holds the record for having the largest number of zero-field SIMs known for any transition metal ion, controlling the magnetic anisotropy in these systems are is still a challenge. In addition to the modern spectroscopic techniques, theoretical studies, especially ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 approaches, have been used to uncover the electronic structure of various CoII SIMs. In this article, with some selected examples, the aim is to showcase how varying the coordination number from two to eight, and the geometry around the CoII centre alters the magnetic anisotropy. This offers some design principles for the experimentalists to target new generation SIMs based on the CoII ion. Additionally, some important FeII/FeIII and NiII complexes exhibiting large magnetic anisotropy and SIM properties are also discussed.}

abstract = {Single-molecule magnets have potential uses in several nanotechnology applications, including high-density information storage devices, the realisation of which lies in enhancing the barrier height for magnetisation reversal (Ueff). However, Ln(iii) single-ion magnets (SIMs) that have been reported recently reveal that the maximum value ofUeffvalues that can be obtained by modulating the ligand fields has already been achieved. Here, we have explored, using a combination of DFT andab initioCASSCF calculations, a unique way to enhance the magnetisation reversal barrier using an oriented external electric field in three well-known Ln(iii) single-ion magnets: [Dy(Py)5(OtBu)2]+(1), [Er{N(SiMe3)2}3Cl]−(2) and [Dy(CpMe3)Cl] (3). Our study reveals that, for apt molecules, if the appropriate direction and values of the electric fields are chosen, the barrier height can be enhanced by twice that of the limit set by the ligand field. The application of an electric field along the equatorial direction was found to be suitable for oblate shaped Dy(iii) complexes and an electric field along the axial direction was found to enhance the barrier height for a prolate Er(iii) complex. For complexes2and3, the external electric field was able to magnify the barrier height to 2-3 times that of the original complexes. However, a moderate enhancement was noticed after application of the external electric field in the case of complex1. This novel non-chemical fine-tuning approach to modulate magnetic anisotropy is expected to yield a new generation of SIMs.}

In these complexes, the neutral non-planar ligand, L, binds to three coordination sites around the metal center while two others are bound by anionic halide/pseudo halide ligands. The coordination geometry of the complexes is dictated by the coordinated anionic ligands. Thus, the coordination geometry around the metal ion is distorted trigonal bipyramidal for complexes 1 and 3, while it is distorted square pyramidal for complex 2. Ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations on the complexes reveal the presence of an easy plane magnetic anisotropy with the D and E/D values being, 13.3 and 0.14 cm-1 for 1; 36.1 and 0.24 cm-1 for 2 and ±8.6 and 0.32 cm-1 for 3. These values are in good agreement with the values that were extracted from the experimental DC data. AC magnetic measurements reveal the presence of a field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization. However, clear maxima in the out-of-phase susceptibility curves were not observed for 1 and 3. For complex 2, peak maxima were observed when the measurements were carried out under an applied field of 1400 Oe which allowed an analysis of the dynamics of the slow relaxation of magnetization. This revealed that the relaxation is mainly controlled by the Raman and direct processes with the values of the parameters found to be: B = 0.77(15) s-1 K-6.35, n = 6.35(12) and A = 3.41(4) × 10-10 s-1 Oe-4 K-1 and m = 4 (fixed). The ab initio calculation which showed the multifunctional nature of the electronic states of the complexes justifies the absence of zero-field SIM behaviour of the complexes. The magnitude and sign of the D and E values and their relationship with the covalency of the metal-ligand bonds was analysed by the CASSCF/NEVPT2 as well as AILFT calculations.}

abstract = {Mononuclear four coordinate CoII complexes have drawn a great deal of attention as they often exhibit excellent single-ion magnet (SIM) properties. Among the reported complexes, the axial zero-field splitting parameter (D) was found to vary drastically both in terms of the sign as well as strength. There are various proposals in this respect such as structural distortions, heavier atom substitution, metal-ligand covalency, tuning secondary coordination sphere, etc. that are expected to control the D values. To assess the importance of structural distortions vs. heavier atom substitution effect, here we have undertaken detailed theoretical studies based on the ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 method to estimate zero-field splitting parameters for twelve complexes reported in the literature. Our test set includes the {CoIIX4} (where X=O, S, Se) core structure where the D value was found to vary from +19 to −118 cm−1. Based on the structural variation, we have classified the complexes into three types (I–III) where type I complexes were found to exhibit the largest negative D value as desired for SIMs. The other two types (II and III) of complexes have been found to be inferior with respect to type I. The secondary coordination sphere was also found to influence D, as substitution on the secondary coordination sphere atom was found to significantly alter the magnitude of D values. Particularly, two structural parameters, namely, the dihedral angle between the two ligand planes and the ∠X-Co-X polar angle were found to heavily influence the sign and strength of D values. Our analysis clearly reveals that these structural factors are much more important than the heavier atom substitution, or metal-ligand covalency. A large variation in the D and E/D values among these complexes despite possessing a very close structural similarity offers an exquisite playground for a chemist to design and develop new-generation CoII-based SIMs.}

abstract = {Single-molecule magnets based on lanthanides are very attractive due to their potential applications proposed in the area of microelectronic devices. Very recent advances in this area are due to the blend of conventional lanthanide chemistry with organometallic ligands, and several breakthrough achievements are attained with this combination. Ab initio methods based on multi-reference CASSCF calculations are playing a vital role in the design and development of such molecules. In this minireview, we aim to appraise various contributions in the area of organometallic lanthanide complexes (those containing lanthanide-carbon bonds) and describe how these robust wavefunction-based methods have played a constructive role not only in rationalizing the observed magnetic properties but also proven to be a potential predictive tool with some selected examples.}

abstract = {Understanding how the magnetic anisotropy in simple coordination complexes can be manipulated is instrumental to the development of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Clear strategies can then be designed to control both the axial and transverse contributions to the magnetic anisotropy in such compounds, and allow them to reach their full potential. Here we show a strategy for boosting the magnetic anisotropy in a series of trigonal bipyramidal Mn(ii) complexes-[MnCl3(HDABCO)(DABCO)] (1), [MnCl3(MDABCO)2]{\textperiodcentered}[ClO4] (2), and [MnCl3(H2O)(MDABCO)] (3). These have been successfully synthesised using the monodentate [DABCO] and [MDABCO]+ ligands. Through static (DC) magnetic measurements and detailed theoretical investigation using ab initio methods, the magnetic anisotropy of each system has been studied. The calculations reveal that the rhombic zero-field splitting (ZFS) term (E) can be tuned as the symmetry around the Mn(ii) ion is changed. Furthermore, an in silico investigation reveals a strategy to increase the axial ZFS parameter (D) of trigonal bipyramidal Mn(ii) by an order of magnitude.}

abstract = {The magnetic properties of 3d monometallic complexes can be tuned through geometric control, owing to their synthetic accessibility and relative structural simplicity. Monodentate ligands offer great potential for fine-tuning the coordination environment to engineer both the axial and rhombic zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters. In [CoCl3(DABCO)(HDABCO)] (1), the trigonal bipyramidal Co(ii) centre has two bulky axial ligands and three equatorial chloride ligands. An in-depth experimental and theoretical study of 1 reveals a large easy-plane magnetic anisotropy (+ve D) with a negligible rhombic zero-field splitting (E) due to the strict axial symmetry imposed by the C3 symmetric ligand and trigonal space group. The large easy-plane magnetic anisotropy (D = +44.5 cm-1) is directly deduced using high-field EPR and frequency-domain magnetic resonance (FDMR) studies. Ab initio calculations reveal a large positive contribution to the D term arising from ground state/excited state mixing of the 4E′′ states at ∼4085 cm-1 and a minor contribution from the spin-flip transition as well. The nature of the slow relaxation in 1 is elucidated through analysis of the rates of relaxation of magnetisation, taking into account Raman and direct spin-lattice relaxation processes and Quantum Tunnelling of the Magnetisation (QTM). The terms relating to the direct process and QTM were found based on the fit of the field-dependence of $\tau$ at 2 K. Subsequently, these were used as fixed parameters in the fit of the temperature-dependence of $\tau$ to obtain the Raman terms. This experimental-theoretical investigation provides further insight into the power of FDMR and ab initio methods for the thorough investigation of magnetic anisotropy. Thus, these results contribute to design criteria for high magnetic anisotropy systems.}

The structures of tetraorganoditelluronic acids 10-13 were authenticated by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. From the molecular structures of 10-13, it was observed that the sp3 N-donor atoms, which were initially involved in intramolecular Te⋯N bonding interactions in diorganotellurides 6-9, did not interact with the tellurium atoms in tetraorganoditelluronic acids 10-13. The 125Te chemical shifts for 10-13 were considerably downfield shifted as compared with the values observed for the corresponding tellurides 6-9. The relative stabilities of the tetraorganoditelluronic acids 10-13 with respect to their lighter analogues (S and Se) have been assessed using DFT calculations.}

At room temperature, reactions of H3L in MeOH with cobalt(II) perchlorate salts led to coassembly of initially formed ligand-bound {CoII2} fragments following aerial oxidation of metal centers and bridging by in situ generated hydroxido/alkoxido groups and added carboxylate anions. Available alkoxido arms of the initially formed {L($\mu$1,3-O2CCH3)($\mu$-OH/OMe)Co2}+ fragments were utilized to trap a central CoII ion during the formation of [Co5] aggregates. In the solid state, both complexes have been characterized by X-ray crystallography, variable-temperature magnetic measurements, and theoretical studies. Both 1 and 2 show field-induced slow magnetic relaxation that arises from the single pseudo-Td CoII ion present. The structural distortion leads to an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy (D = -31.31 cm-1 for 1 and -21.88 cm-1 for 2) and a small but non-negligible transverse component (E/D = 0.11 for 1 and 0.08 for 2). The theoretical studies also reveal how the O-Co-O bond angles and the interplanar angles control D and E values in 1 and 2. The presence of two diamagnetic {Co2($\mu$-L)} hosts controls the distortion of the central {CoO4} unit, highlighting a strategy to control single-ion magnetic anisotropy by trapping single ions within a diamagnetic coordination environment.}

abstract = {Understanding and controlling magnetic anisotropy at the level of a single metal ion is vital if the miniaturisation of data storage is to continue to evolve into transformative technologies. Magnetic anisotropy is essential for a molecule-based magnetic memory as it pins the magnetic moment of a metal ion along the easy axis. Devices will require deposition of magnetic molecules on surfaces, where changes in molecular structure can significantly alter magnetic properties. Furthermore, if we are to use coordination complexes with high magnetic anisotropy as building blocks for larger systems we need to know how magnetic anisotropy is affected by structural distortions. Here we study a trigonal bipyramidal nickel(ii) complex where a giant magnetic anisotropy of several hundred wavenumbers can be engineered. By using high pressure, we show how the magnetic anisotropy is strongly influenced by small structural distortions. Using a combination of high pressure X-ray diffraction, ab initio methods and high pressure magnetic measurements, we find that hydrostatic pressure lowers both the trigonal symmetry and axial anisotropy, while increasing the rhombic anisotropy. The ligand-metal-ligand angles in the equatorial plane are found to play a crucial role in tuning the energy separation between the dx2-y2 and dxy orbitals, which is the determining factor that controls the magnitude of the axial anisotropy. These results demonstrate that the combination of high pressure techniques with ab initio studies is a powerful tool that gives a unique insight into the design of systems that show giant magnetic anisotropy.}
