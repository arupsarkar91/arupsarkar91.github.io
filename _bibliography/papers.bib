abstract = {Modeling actinides with electronic structure theories is challenging because these systems present a strong ligand field and metal-ligand covalency. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of pair-density functional theory (PDFT) for the calculation of vertical excitation energies in An(III), [AnIIICl6]3-, and [AnVIO2]2+ (An = U, Np, Pu, and Am). We compare the performance of PDFT, hybrid PDFT, and multistate PDFT with traditional active-space methods followed by perturbation theory, like multistate CASPT2, and with experimental data. Overall, multistate PDFT gives quantitative agreement with multistate CASPT2 at a significantly reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {Two possible explanations for the temperature dependence of spin-crossover (SCO) behavior in the dimeric triple-decker Cr(II) complex ([($\eta$5-C5Me5)Cr($\mu$2:$\eta$5-P5)Cr($\eta$5-C5Me5)]+) have been offered. One invokes variations in antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions, whereas the other posits the development of a strong ligand-field effect favoring the low-spin ground state. We perform multireference electronic structure calculations based on the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory to resolve these effects. We find quintet, triplet, and singlet electronic ground states, respectively, for the experimental geometries at high, intermediate, and low temperatures. The ground-state transition from quintet to triplet at an intermediate temperature derives from increased antiferromagnetic interactions between the two Cr(II) ions. By contrast, the ground-state transition from triplet to singlet at low temperature can be attributed to increased ligand-field effects, which dominate with continued variations in antiferromagnetic coupling. This study provides quantitative detail for the degree to which these two effects can act in concert for the observed SCO behavior in this complex and others subject to temperature-dependent variations in geometry.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
